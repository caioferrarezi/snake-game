This is just a playground to implement the snake game.

The repo has the JavaScript and Lua (made with LÃ–VE framework) versions.

If you wanna test the web version, check out the [demo page](https://caioferrarezi.github.io/snake-game/demo/).

You can also play the Lua version by cloning the repo, [installing the framework](https://love2d.org/), navigating to project's folder and type on your terminal:

```
$ love lua/
```

Thank you! :tada:
