![snake game screenshot](https://github.com/caioferrarezi/snake-game/blob/master/snake-game.png)

This is just a playground to implement the snake game.

The repo has the JavaScript and Lua (made with LÖVE framework) versions.

If you wanna test the web version, check out the [demo page](https://caioferrarezi.github.io/snake-game/demo/).

You can also play the Lua version by cloning the repo, [installing the framework](https://love2d.org/), navigating to project's folder and type on your terminal:

```
$ love lua/
```

Thank you! :tada:
